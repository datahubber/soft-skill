### Creativity  
Created an original ideal of using greedy algorithm to make a study plan in CS5800 project. Result limited by the vague data, but it established a concept that when a student want to make a study plan with limited time, how can he optimize.  

### Teamwork  
By promoting my project idea, I found four teammates and we formed a team of five. I finalized the work schedule with them, discussed the division of labor, and eventually achieved results that were appreciated by my professor.  

### Communication  
Didn't do a good job in the first presentation of the first semester. But wrote down how to improve, and by reading <Story Telling with Data> and practicing, did much better in the second presetation.
