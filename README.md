### Creativity  
Inspired by the greedy algorithm taught in my professor's class, I decided to come up with an original project idea that uses the greedy algorithm to solve a real-life problem. Using greedy algorithm to make a study plan in CS5800 project. It established a concept that when a student want to make a study plan with limited time, how can he optimize. I hope this project could save some time for my classmates when they want to make a study plan.  

### Teamwork  
By promoting my project idea, I found four teammates and we formed a team of five. I finalized the work schedule with them, discussed the division of labor, and eventually achieved results that were appreciated by my professor.  

### Communication  
Didn't do a good job in the first presentation of the first semester. But wrote down how to improve, and by reading "Story Telling with Data" and practicing, did much better in the second presetation(have eye contact with audience, use some guesture, use contrast color to highlight the key data).
